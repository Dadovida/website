        <h1>Manifesto</h1>
        <p>Our product is progress towards fitness: the capacity to move gracefully through the world. We recognize fitness as an infinite game—a journey without a finish line. We respect the spark of competition, but we revere the flame of consistency. Modern society conspires against this discipline. Between hyper-palatable foods and the digital dopamine loop, the world is drifting toward a sedentary future. We are the resistance to that drift. Our mission is to restore and elevate the art of human movement. Here is our strategy.</p>
        
        <p>We focus on range of motion, an underserved but critical aspect of fitness. To track it, we need Full Body Pose Estimation (FBPE). Current tech is too bulky for consumers, so our main hurdle is reducing friction. The objective is 24/7 data, collected effortlessly. Our roadmap is simple: start with the best technology available today and aggressively refine towards an imperceptible form factor.</p>
        
        <p>Continuous pose estimation creates the foundation for the ultimate self-coaching engine. We begin by digitizing primal archetypes like the squat, hinge, press, and lunge. We don’t just measure movement; we aim to correct it, coaching users toward structural integrity. This creates a closed feedback loop where abstract ambitions become quantifiable milestones. A goal like 'doing the splits' transforms into a precise, trackable metric of degrees. Our design mandate is clear: we must make the pursuit of these metrics as delightful as the results themselves.</p>
        
        <p>We are the first test subjects. To accelerate iteration, our headquarters will house a high-performance fitness facility woven into our engineering workflow. We will broadcast our personal transformations, and share what we learn. Interested observers are invited to join us, driving the data flywheel. This physical hub generates the biomechanical data, and coaching expertise necessary to perfect our system. From this foundation, we will scale to a digital platform that democratizes elite coaching, pulling the world back to the path of movement.</p>
